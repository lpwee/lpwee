## 👋🏻 Hi, I’m Ping Wee.

I am currently:

Studying!

I used to be:

- 🔭 Project Intern @ Nethermind
- 🤖 AI Engineer Intern @ Temus

I like to write software that people will find useful. But otherwise I spend my time collecting skills that I think will be useful for building software in the future :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cloud computing & system design (well i am finding time to read in my free time)

Reach out to me if you have any ideas/knowledge to share!
